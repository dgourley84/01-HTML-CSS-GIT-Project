## Description

After reviewing the CSS and HTML for Horiseon webpage there were a number of refactoring items to be completed.
These included:

- Swtiching the non-semantic elements of the webpage to semantic.
- Including comments within the HTML to give context to the goal of each element and section
- refactoring the CSS file to remove duplications. Move some of the element definitions to the top of the page in order to have better flow from universal to element to class to id.
- maintain the id's for the nav bar to ensure that the page can still navigate.

Key learnings were how to identify and amend duplication with the CSS using developer tools on the browser to inspect and follow the styling flow.

Also the clarifcation and gain experiance in semantic elements and their use in HTML.
